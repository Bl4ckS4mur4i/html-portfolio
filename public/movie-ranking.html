<h1>The best movie trilogies according to Edson!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Trilogies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
The most perfect rendition of the epic adventures of the fellowship of the ring by Peter Jackson.
</p>

<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>
I haven't laughed this much in any other comedy movie. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are the GOATS of comedy.
</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
Nothing much to say, it's just crazy, especially the first one. The fourth? No idea.
